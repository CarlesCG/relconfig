## Zero-failure time testing partial  
If the amount of test time accumulated on each unit is constrained, this tab can be used to determine the number of units required for the test.  
For example, suppose in the Zero-Failure Test plans example that no more than 300 hours could be accumulated on any bearing system.  
+ What is the required sample size for the test to fulfill the required level of reliability?

### Reliability test desing
In a no-failure test, if a failure occurs prematurely, the test has been failed. A redesign is in order. It is inappropriate and in fact, wrong, cheating, to test another set of the same design or to shift to a one or zero failure test plan. The test plan cannot be modified after the test has started. There may be large economic
reasons for these inappropriate responses to failure, but they should be resisted. For example, if enough sets of three roller bearings is allowed to be tested, a set will be found that passes the test even if there is no improvement.
