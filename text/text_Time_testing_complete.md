## Reliability Test Design 
When a redesign is made to correct an existing failure mode, tests are made to show the new design is an improvement. The tests are required as not all redesigns are improvements. How many units must be tested without failure, for how long, to substantiate that the new design is significantly better than the existing design? Alternatively, the test objective may be to demonstrate a design requirement expressed as a reliability or probability of failure at some design life.
The success data from the test may be used to determine a lower confidence bound for the Weibull line for the new design, called a "Weibayes" line. The test design criteria may allow zero failures, or zero or one failure, etc. as alternatives.


## Zero-Failure Test plans 
Frequently, a manufacturer will have to demonstrate that a certain product has met a goal of a certain reliability at a given time with a specific confidence.  

Suppose that ball and roller bearing unbalance test follows a Weibull failure mode, with beta = 2, and eta = 500 hours. This was not adequate life so the system is redesigned and three redesigned units are available for testing. Now the question is:  
- How many hours should each system be tested to demonstrate that this mode of unbalance has been eliminated or significantly improved?  

  
Note that the Weibayes plot is a good tracking tool during the test; updating the Weibayes plot daily shows what you have demonstrated and when the test will be completed.
