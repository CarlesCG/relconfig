### Zero-Failure Test plans 
Suppose that ball and roller bearing unbalance test follows a Weibull failure mode, with beta= 2, and eta = 500 hours. This was not adequate life so the system is redesigned and three redesigned units are available for testing. Now the question is:  
+ How many hours should each system be tested to demonstrate that this mode of unbalance has been eliminated or significantly improved?
